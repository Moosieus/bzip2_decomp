Okay, okay calm down calm down get a grip now - Oh this is an interesting sensation what is it? It's a sort of a tingling in my - well I suppose I better start finding names for things!

Let's call it uhmmm... tail! Yeah! Tail! And hey what's this roaring sound, whooshing past what I'm suddenly gonna call my head?

Wind! Is that a good name? It'll do...

Yay, this is really exciting! I'm dizzy with anticipation, or is the wind? There's an awful lotta that now isn't there? And what's this thing coming towards me very fast, so big and flat and round it needs a big wide sounding name like, ow...ownd...ground - Ground! That's it! Ground! Hah! I wonder if it'll be friends with me.

Hello, Ground!
